# We Rate Dogs Tweet Analysis

In this project, I analysed tweets from `WeRateDogs` twitter account [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates)

The tweets were for the time period Nov 1, 2015 - Aug 1, 2017.

Key insights drawn from the data were: 
+ The Golden Retriever was the most common dog breed
+ The twitter account had a very active account manager in 2015
+ 2017's tweets the best social media engagement
+ Puppers were the most common dog stage
+ Dog names are almost as many as the owners
